<p><span class="term">Accuracy: </span>One of four categories of evaluation standards used with the CDC Evaluation Framework. Accuracy considers whether the approach at each step is accurate, given the needs of the stakeholders and the purpose of the evaluation.</p>

<p><span class="term">Activities:</span> Actions that comprise the program, in this case identifying the problem and developing and implementing the policy effort.</p>

<p><span class="term">Administrative Action: </span>As used in this course, any action or decision made or issued by an agency, such as an executive order, to implement a policy or program.</p>

<p><span class="term">Evaluation: </span>The systematic collection of information about the activities, characteristics, and outcomes of programs (which may include interventions, policies, and specific projects) to make judgments about that program, improve program effectiveness, and/or inform future decisions about program development.</p>

<p><span class="term">Experimental Design: </span>An evaluation design that attempts to ensure the initial equivalence of one or more control groups to a treatment group by administratively creating the groups through random assignment, thereby ensuring their mathematical equivalence.</p>

<p><span class="term">Feasibility: </span>One of four categories of evaluation standards used with the CDC Evaluation Framework. Feasibility considers whether the evaluation procedures are practical, given the time, resources, and expertise available.</p>

<p><span class="term">Incentive: </span>Meant to motivate or encourage a desired outcome.</p>

<p><span class="term">Indicators: </span>Specific, observable, and measurable variables that show the progress a policy is making toward achieving a specified outcome.</p>

<p><span class="term">Inputs: </span>Information or resources required for developing/implementing policy.</p>
  
<p><span class="term">Law: </span>Federal laws are enacted by Congress and signed into law by the president.</p>

<p><span class="term">Logic Model: </span>A systematic and visual way to present the perceived relationships among resources for a policy effort, the activities of that effort, and the changes or outcomes of that policy. The logic model visually depicts the linear pathways between the policy activities and specific outcomes, as well as the links between intermediate and long-term outcomes and impacts.</p>
  
<p><span class="term">Measures: </span>The methods by which one observes indicators.</p>
  
<p><span class="term">Mixed Methods Evaluation: </span>A design for collecting, analyzing, and mixing both quantitative and qualitative data in a single study or series of studies to understand an evaluation problem. (Adapted from Creswell and Plano Clark.)</p>
  
<p><span class="term">Non-experimental Design: </span>An evaluation design that includes timeâ€“series analysis, cross-sectional surveys, and case studies. Non-experimental designs can provide valuable information but do not include a comparison group and are not able to provide evidence of a causal link between a policy and any outcomes.</p>

<p><span class="term">Outcomes: </span>Short-term, intermediate, and long-term changes in target audience behaviors, awareness of risk factors, attitudes, and knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="term">Outcomes: </span>Direct products or deliverables that result from the activities.</p>

<p><span class="term">Policy Analysis: </span>A systematic process involving the use of quantitative and qualitative methods to identify, compare and select policy interventions that will achieve objectives and maximize outcomes most efficiently. Policy analysis is used in government and other institutions to develop and implement laws, regulations, procedures, administrative actions, incentives or voluntary practices and evaluate their impact.</p>

<p><span class="term">Policy Evaluation: </span>The systematic collection and analysis of information to make judgments about contexts, activities, characteristics, or outcomes of one or more domain(s) of the policy process. </p>
<p>Evaluation may inform and improve policy development, adoption, implementation, and effectiveness, and builds the evidence base for policy interventions.
</p>

<p><span class="term">Policy: </span> At CDC, we define policy as a law, regulation, procedure, administrative action, incentive, or voluntary practice of governments and other institutions.</p>

<p><span class="term">Primary Data: </span> New information one collects.</p>

<p><span class="term">Procedure: </span> A procedure is an established or official way of doing something.</p>

<p><span class="term">Program: </span> Describes any organized public health action. Programs can include, among others, direct service interventions, community mobilization efforts, research initiatives, surveillance systems, outbreak investigations, laboratory diagnostics, communication campaigns, infrastructure building projects, training and education services, and administrative systems.</p>

<p><span class="term">Propriety: </span> One of four categories of evaluation standards used with the CDC Evaluation Framework. Propriety considers whether the evaluation is being conducted in a fair and ethical way.</p>

<p><span class="term">Qualitative Data: </span> Information that is not numerical and describes attributes or properties of an object or activity.</p>

<p><span class="term">Quantitative Data: </span> Numeric information that can be analyzed to measure policy outcomes, whether they are short-term, intermediate, or long-term, intended or unintended.</p>

<p><span class="term">Quasi-experimental Design: </span> A study structures that uses comparison groups to draw causal inferences but does not use randomization to create the treatment and control groups. The treatment group is usually given. The control group is selected to match the treatment group as closely as possible so that inferences on the incremental impacts of the program can be made.</p>
  
<p><span class="term">Regulation: </span> A regulation (also referred to as a rule) is a general statement issued by an agency, board, or commission that has the force and effect of law. Congress often grants agencies the authority to issue regulations. Federal regulations specify the details and requirements necessary to implement and enforce legislation enacted by Congress.</p>

<p><span class="term">Secondary Data: </span> Existing information sources (e.g., literature review, environmental scan).</p>

<p><span class="term">Utility: </span> One of four categories of evaluation standards used with the CDC Evaluation Framework. Utility considers who wants the evaluation results and for what purpose.</p>

<p><span class="term">Window of Opportunity: </span> When various factors combine to make conditions ripe for policy enactment and adoption. According to John Kingdon, open policy windows can occur when policies: (1) are congruent with the national mood; (2) enjoy interest group support; (3) lack organized opposition; (4) fit the orientation of the prevailing legislative coalition or administration; (5) are technologically feasible; and (6) have budget workability.</p>
