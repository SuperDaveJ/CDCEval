<h1 class="popTitle">Demonstrating Value of Policy and Accountability for Resources Used</h1>

<p>Evaluation  can be used to estimate the benefit of a policy and calculate a return on  investment. These economic evaluations assess the effectiveness across the  domains of the policy process using various economic indicators. As an example,  the <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/ivac/projects/decade-of-vaccine-economics.html" target="_blank">Decade of Vaccines Economics  (DoVE)</a> project demonstrated substantial health and economic benefits  from increased access to new and existing vaccines. </p>
<p>The  researchers showed that increasing the use of six vaccines over a ten-year  period could save the lives of 6.4 million children in some of the world&rsquo;s  poorest countries (based on the Lives Saved Tool and projections of  immunization coverage from the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy). </p>
<p>Using  these health impact projections, another team of researchers was then able to  calculate the economic value of these health gainsâ€”approximately $231 billion. <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2011/ivac-vaccine-studies.html" target="_blank">Click this link to read more about this  research</a>.</p>
