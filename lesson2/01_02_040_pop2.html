<h1 class="popTitle">Determining Which Policies May Be Most Effective</h1>

<p>Evaluation can help you identify policies that  are likely to be the most effective in addressing a particular public health  problem. This usually occurs within the Policy Analysis domain of the policy  process. For example, through the &ldquo;Together We Can&rdquo; initiative, the Central  Michigan District Health Department used a specific process to choose evidence-informed  strategies to improve the overall health of people in the district and promote  wellness. The department hosted a public health summit, during which  participants were updated on the results of a community needs assessment and  participated in a brainstorming session to identify priority areas. </p>
<p>Staff at the health department then took  the suggestions from the summit and examined evidence of their effectiveness  using recommendations from:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/roadmaps/what-works-for-health" target="_blank">What  Works for Health</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thecommunityguide.org/index.html" target="_blank">CDC&rsquo;s The Community Guide</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/default.aspx" target="_blank">Healthy People 2020</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, they categorized strategies based on  stakeholder support and evidence of effectiveness. <br />
  For strategies suggested that didn&rsquo;t have  strong evidence, the staff performed research to determine whether other health  departments in the nation were doing similar work. They found articles,  toolkits, and websites for professional organizations. The categorization was  then presented to a council of stakeholders and, through consensus, they chose  strategies to include in their <a href="http://www.cmdhd.org/pdf/together_we_can/CMDHD_CHNA-IP_Mar14.pdf" target="_blank">Community  Health Assessment and Improvement Plan</a>.</p>
