<h1 class="popTitle">Identifying Gaps in Implementation and Enforcement</h1>

<p>Evaluation can help you identify gaps in implementation and enforcement. This usually  occurs within the Policy Implementation domain of the policy process. For example, in 2001, Texas passed <a href="http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jphp/journal/v30/nS1/pdf/jphp200864a.pdf" target="_blank">Senate Bill 19</a>, requiring students in publicly funded elementary schools to participate in  physical activity. The bill also requires schools to implement a coordinated school health program.</p>
<p>In order to examine awareness of and adherence to Senate Bill 19 in a sample of elementary schools and two public health regions, a team conducted statewide, structured  interviews with principals. The team also identified differences by region,  which suggested that Senate Bill 19 was not being implemented consistently  across the state, and that certain regions required additional support around  implementation. The results also illustrated the importance of monitoring  implementation of enacted legislation in order for policies to have their  intended impact.</p>
