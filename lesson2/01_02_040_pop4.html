<h1 class="popTitle">Preparing for Windows of Opportunity</h1>

<p>Sometimes  various factors combine to make conditions ripe for policy enactment and  adoption. According to John Kingdon, open policy windows can occur when  policies: </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Are congruent       with the national mood.</li>
  <li>Enjoy interest       group support.</li>
  <li>Lack organized       opposition.</li>
  <li>Fit the       orientation of the prevailing legislative coalition or administration.</li>
  <li>Are       technologically feasible.</li>
  <li>Have budget       workability.</li>
</ol>
<p>Preparing  for windows of opportunity is likely to occur within the Strategy and Policy  Development domain of the policy process.</p>
<p>In  some circumstances, policy may need to be made before all variables are certain  or known. For example, decision-makers in one state may be considering passing  a law similar to one implemented a few years ago in another state. Although the  decision-makers may have requested data about the health impacts of the policy,  there may be few studies at this point to provide reliable data.</p>
<p>In  this type of situation, the issue may call for partial evidence available to  inform the decision. In such circumstances, one strong study that evaluates the  effects of the policy may be considered promising enough to present preliminary  data to inform decision-makers. </p>
<p>In  the absence of a window of opportunity, public health practitioners can  continue research to expand the evidence base for policy recommendations so  that additional data is available when an opportunity is presented.</p>
