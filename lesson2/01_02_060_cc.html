<p>In the Problem Identification domain, the community assesses where and when community members are exposed to secondhand smoke, particularly those who are at greatest risk, such as children with asthma or older adults. Based on this information, the community develops a problem statement.</p>
  
<p>Opportunities for policy evaluation include evaluating the problem statement according to the evidence base, determining whether the problem can be addressed through policy, and assessing stakeholder engagement within this domain.</p>

<p>Policy evaluation within the Problem Identification domain can lead to a more effective problem statement to guide policy analysis and development.</p>

<p>During the Policy Analysis domain, the community convenes stakeholders and considers potential policy options to reduce secondhand smoke exposure.</p>

<p>Opportunities for policy evaluation within this domain include assessing stakeholder engagement, determining whether the data review is sufficient, and identifying criteria that will be used to assess the policy options and the process used to compare policies.</p>

<p>Policy evaluation within the Policy Analysis domain can lead to more effective stakeholder engagement, help to identify policy that is likely to have a positive impact, and help identify additional data that can inform policy development.</p>

<p>During the Strategy and Policy Development domain, the community prioritizes getting an ordinance to prohibit smoking in recreation areas, and they develop draft language for the ordinance.</p>

<p>Opportunities for policy evaluation within this domain include evaluating the viability of the prioritization based on evidence, assessing stakeholder engagement, and assessing the drafted ordinance to ensure that it is based on evidence, is worded strongly enough to enable enforcement, and is consistent with model policy guidance.</p>

<p>Policy evaluation within this domain can lead to more effective prioritization and can inform the development of draft language that meets stakeholders’ identified needs and is based on evidence and model policy guidance.</p>

<p>During the Policy Enactment domain, the community engages additional partners, identifies a local champion, monitors the process by which the policy was, or was not, enacted, and raises public awareness.</p>

<p>Opportunities for policy evaluation within this domain include assessing stakeholder engagement, assessing public awareness of the problem and the proposed solution, identifying barriers or facilitators to enactment, assessing differences between the policy language and requirements as drafted and as enacted.</p>

<p>Policy evaluation within the Policy Enactment domain can document its success or failure, can identify barriers and facilitators, and can contribute to the evidence base for how to successfully enact policy.</p>

<p>During the Policy Implementation domain, the community engages stakeholders, identifies or collects baseline data, and creates an implementation and monitoring plan. Then the community implements the policy and works with local police and other community leaders to enforce it. The community identifies and collects data during the policy implementation process, reporting evaluation findings and continuing to raise awareness along the way.</p>

<p>Opportunities for policy evaluation within this domain include evaluating enforcement, implementation, and outputs.</p>

<p>Policy evaluation within this domain can complement outcome evaluation to inform the evidence base, lead to improved implementation and enforcement, inform development of modified or additional interventions, and help in identifying unintended outcomes.</p>

<p>As overarching activities, the community engages stakeholders throughout the process. The community identifies or collects baseline, interim, and/or follow-up data, reports evaluation findings, and continues to raise awareness.</p>

<p>Additional opportunities for policy evaluation include evaluating short-term, intermediate, and long-term health outcomes, costs and benefits, and cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p>Policy evaluation as an overarching activity can build the evidence base, identify the policy’s impacts on public health, provide return-on-investment data, and identify unintended outcomes.</p>
