<h1 class="popTitle">Contributions to the Evidence Base</h1>

<p>Evaluating  the health outcomes of a policy contributes to the evidence base and could lead  to the documentation of additional policies that could benefit public health  beyond what was originally envisioned. In addition, the evaluation can  sometimes uncover unintended outcomes—whether positive or negative. For  example, secondhand smoke policies were originally intended to reduce lung  cancer and other respiratory conditions. However, reductions in heart attacks  were also documented when secondhand smoke policies were implemented, pointing  to the need to consider a wide range of health outcomes when evaluating  policies. Impact or outcome evaluations assess the effectiveness across the  domains of the policy process on one or more public health outcomes.</p>
