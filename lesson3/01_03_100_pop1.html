    	<td><strong>Legislative or Policy  Databases</strong> <strong>and Documents</strong></td>
        <td><p>Legislative or policy databases are a key  tool in comparing policies across jurisdictions (including international,  national, state and local). These  databases contain detailed information about policies including content,  context, and other relevant variables. This can make the task of compiling and  comparing policies much easier. For example, the Congress.gov site provides  federal legislative information with several search options. In addition, the  National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a searchable database of  state laws and regulations. Links are provided on the course Resources page.</p>
          <p>Additional sources of legislative or policy  information include legal documents, regulations, amendments, and court  rulings. </p>
          <p>More examples:</p>

      <td><p><strong>Interviews or Focus  Groups</strong></p></td>
      <td><p>This can include structured or  semi-structured interviews of key stakeholders or focus groups conducted with a  number of stakeholders at once. </p>
        <p>As an example, the Public Health  Informatics Institute conducted structured telephone interviews with a variety  of stakeholder groups to gather information related to childhood obesity. They  followed up with in-depth meetings and discussions with representatives from  the Arkansas Department of Health, which had been measuring the BMI of all  school children, and the Santa Cruz, California Department of Health, which had  been collecting data about the health of local Hispanic children. To read about  their findings, consult the link on the Resources page.</p>

      <td><p><strong>Stakeholder Surveys</strong></p></td>
      <td><p>Stakeholder surveys can collect  quantitative and/or qualitative data and be conducted in a number of different  methods (paper, online, telephone, etc.).</p>
        <p>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)  collects data on a broad range of health topics through personal household  interviews (via the U.S. Census Bureau). Survey results have been instrumental  in providing data to track health status, health care access, and progress  toward achieving national health objectives.</p>
