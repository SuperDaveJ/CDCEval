<ul>
  <li><em>Experimental (or  randomized) designs </em>try  to ensure the initial equivalence of one or more control groups to a treatment  group by administratively creating the groups through random assignment,  thereby ensuring their mathematical equivalence.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><em>Quasi-experimental  designs </em>are  study structures that use comparison groups to draw causal inferences but do  not use randomization to create the treatment and control groups. The treatment  group is usually given. The control group is selected to match the treatment  group as closely as possible so that inferences on the incremental impacts of  the program can be made.</li>
  <li><em>Non-experimental/observational  designs </em>include,  but are not limited to, timeâ€“series analysis, cross-sectional surveys, and case  studies. Non-experimental designs can provide valuable information but do not  include a comparison group and are not able to provide evidence of a causal  link between a policy and any outcomes.</li>
  <li><em>Mixed methods evaluation</em> is a design for  collecting, analyzing, and mixing both quantitative and qualitative data in a  single study or series of studies to understand an evaluation problem. (Adapted  from Creswell and Plano Clark.)</li>
