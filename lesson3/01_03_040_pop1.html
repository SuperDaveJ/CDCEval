      <td><p>Resistance  from vested interests coupled with limited public support have impeded the  enactment of many policies such as those requiring graphic warning labels on  cigarettes or restricting sales of large-sized sugar sweetened beverages. </p>
Implementation also may be  limited, such as when state budget cuts eliminate infrastructure required to  monitor or enforce new policies.</td>

      <td>The  underlying logic behind prohibiting smoking in public areas will reduce  exposure to secondhand smoke, which will subsequently decrease related negative  health impacts.</td>
