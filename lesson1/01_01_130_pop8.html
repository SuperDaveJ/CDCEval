<p><strong>Engaging Stakeholders</strong></p>
<p>This part of the framework entails  involving those people and organizations with a direct interest in the  evaluation and the evaluation process.</p>
<p>Additional details are included in the  document, <a href="../resources/1engagingstakeholders.pdf" target="_blank">Engaging  Stakeholders</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Describing the  Program</strong></p>
<p>In this step, you develop a clear  description of the intervention including purpose, activities, and intended  outcomes/impact.<br />
  Additional details are included in the  document, <a href="../resources/2describingtheprogram.pdf" target="_blank">Describing the Program</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Focusing Evaluation  Design</strong></p>
<p>Focusing the evaluation design involves  deciding what questions the evaluation will answer and what design and  methodology will be needed to answer the questions.</p>
<p>Additional details are included in the  document, <a href="../resources/3focusingtheevaluationdesign.pdf" target="_blank">Focusing  the Evaluation Design</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Gathering Credible  Evidence</strong></p>
<p>In this step, you will identify how to  measure selected outcomes and indicators, and collect the required data.</p>
<p>Additional details are included in the  document, <a href="../resources/4gatheringcredibleevidence.pdf" target="_blank">Gathering  Credible Evidence</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Justifying  Conclusions</strong></p>
<p>This step involves examining evidence  collected and testing conclusions against criteria agreed upon by stakeholders.</p>
<p>Additional details are included in the  document, <a href="../resources/5justifyingconclusions.pdf" target="_blank">Justifying Conclusions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring Use of  Findings and Sharing Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<p>You will need to ensure the application of  evaluation results by designing the evaluation to achieve intended use of  stakeholders, providing feedback to stakeholders, disseminating results of the  evaluation to target audiences, and following-up on the use of the results.</p>
<p>Additional details are included in the  document, <a href="../resources/6ensuringuse.pdf" target="_blank">Ensuring  Use and Sharing Lessons Learned</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Categories of  Standards</strong></p>
<p>The framework also includes a list of  standards that are important to keep in mind when conducting any type of  evaluation. These standards are categorized into four groups, and the framework  asks you to apply each of these four groups as a &ldquo;lens&rdquo; to help isolate the  best approaches at each step.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="132" align="center" valign="top"><strong>UTILITY</strong></td>
    <td width="408" valign="top"><p>Who wants the evaluation results and for    what purpose?</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="132" align="center" valign="top"><p><strong>FEASIBILITY</strong></p></td>
    <td width="408" valign="top"><p>Are the evaluation procedures practical,    given the time, resources, and expertise available?</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="132" align="center" valign="top"><p><strong>PROPRIETY</strong></p></td>
    <td width="408" valign="top"><p>Is the evaluation being conducted in a    fair and ethical way?</p></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="132" align="center" valign="top"><p><strong>ACCURACY</strong></p></td>
    <td width="408" valign="top"><p>Are the approaches at each step accurate,    given the needs of the stakeholders and the purpose of the evaluation?</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These standards don&rsquo;t dictate how to conduct  an evaluation; rather, they help assess the many options at each of the six  steps and choose the options that are best suited to the particular evaluation.</p>
