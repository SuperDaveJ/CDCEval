<h1 class="popTitle">Policy Approach</h1>

<p>Practitioners might partner with local  schools to implement a district-level policy that requires students to engage  in 30 minutes of physical activity each day. The policy allows for flexibility  in how schools will meet the policy&rsquo;s requirements.</p>
<p>Practitioners may create a planning team to  assess existing practices and resources and collaboratively select from  available options, such as adding physical education (PE) classes to the school  day, extending the duration of PE class time, or increasing the amount of time  students are active during PE class. They would then create implementation  plans that address requirements of the district-level policy while integrating  the selected approach within the unique circumstances at the school. </p>
<p>To evaluate the school&rsquo;s new policy, the  evaluators will determine when the &ldquo;policy intervention&rdquo; began (e.g., when the  planning team convened to analyze options and develop a policy, or when they  began implementing the selected policy).</p>
<p>Because the policy is  ongoing, they also will decide when to assess outcomes. The policy is designed  to involve multiple stakeholders and affect the entire student population;  therefore, identifying sources of evaluation data may not be clear. For  example, if the policy required that physical activity be incorporated into  academic class time, the evaluator may use observational or survey techniques  to assess whether or not these changes occurred. In addition, the evaluator may  work with the schools to identify the key changes that they expect to occur as  a result of the increased activity.</p>
