<h1 class="popTitle">Dealing with Uncertainty</h1>

<p>Policy  efforts may be more uncertain and dynamic than programmatic efforts, and you  generally do not have control over implementation, participants, and affected  parties. Likewise, the affected parties may not have control over policies that  are implemented. Although with programs, people often choose to participate or  receive services, they may not have any choice as to whether to participate in a  policy. In addition, there may be more variation in the timeline around policy  efforts, whereas a programmatic effort is likely to have a known and defined  timeframe, such as a specific funding period.</p>
